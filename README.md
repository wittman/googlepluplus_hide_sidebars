# GooglePlusPlus Hide Sidebars

The `googleplusplus_hide_sidebars` user script changes appearance of Google Plus (aka Google+ aka G+) by hiding left and right side bars and widening main content containers. This feature is sticky and will show either a Hide Sidebars link or Show Sidebars link.

> **Install**: <http://go.wittman.org/wdjg>

So far, this userscript was tested in Google Chrome 12 and Firefox 5 (Greasemonkey required) (on OS X).

This is experimental, alpha quality code. Depending on the activity/navigation within Google+, you have to refresh the browser for the script to re-format the page properly.

Feedback is welcome.
