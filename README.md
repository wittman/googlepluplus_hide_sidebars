# GooglePlusPlus Hide Sidebars

The `googleplusplus_hide_sidebars` is a user script for Google Plus (aka Google+ aka G+) that adds a feature to hide/show left and right side bars, and makes the main content wider. This feature is sticky and will show either a Hide Sidebars link or Show Sidebars link.

> **Install**: <http://go.wittman.org/wdjg>

So far, this userscript was tested in Google Chrome 12 and Firefox 5 (Greasemonkey required) (on OS X).

Feedback is welcome.
